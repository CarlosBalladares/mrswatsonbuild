# MrsWatson Build

This docker file will allow anyone to build MrsWatson in a docker continer with debian stretch as base image. Feel free to extend it according to your needs.

## Why is it necessary 
While the original project has binaries, they don't work as expected. And it is best to build binaries for your plattform. 
Making this Dockerfile took me a few days of reading error logs and it will take you 1 copy+paste. Consider leaving a star if this is useful or opening an issue if something is wrong or can be improved.
